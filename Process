*How to create process*
***********************
1. The process are created using fork().
2. only a process can create another process.
3. Generally "INIT" & "[kthread]"has the process ID 1 & 2 respectively and parent process Id as 0. These two process created by
   kernal at boot time.
   INIT:
      Which is responsible for starting & shutting down the machine.
   Kthread:
      In modern system some processes execute the kernal code and managed on user space.
      Theses processes are "spawnned" by kthread (which is INIT for kernal threads). 
      All kernal processes are denotes with [] brackets, this can be viewed using process listing "ps".      
4. process having PID = 0 is swapper, which is responsible for pagging and part of kernal operation.
5. SPAWNNING:
      Performs both fork() & exec() is called spawnning.

  /* If child is created successfully fork returns a value 0 */
  /* with the return value parent & child can be distinguished */
  
  if (RC == 0)
  {
    printf("entered into the child process: %d\n",getpid());
  }
	else
		printf("re-entered to parent pid: %d\n",getpid());
