Process memory layout
**********************
A process is logically divided into the following parts, known as segments:
􀁺 Text: the instructions of the program.
􀁺 Data: the static variables used by the program.
􀁺 Heap: an area from which programs can dynamically allocate extra memory.
􀁺 Stack: a piece of memory that grows and shrinks as functions are called and
return and that is used to allocate storage for local variables and function call
linkage information.
